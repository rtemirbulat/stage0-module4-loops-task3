Tasks:
1. Range sum.

Write a program that will print the sum between numbers given as method arguments:

public class RangeSum {
    public void printSumInclusive(int firstBoarder, int secondBoarder) {
    }
}

2. Alphabet.

Write a program that will write to console English alphabet.

public class AlphabetPrinter {
    public  void printAlphabet() {
    }
}

3. GCD.

Write a program that will print the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers given as method arguments:

public class GreatestCommonDivisor {
    public void printGCD(int first, int second) {
    }
}

4. Digits sum.

Write a program that will find the sum of digits of a given number passed as a method argument. There are some tips: if you concatenate int with string you will be able to use string.length() and iterate till the end. you shouldn't use other String methods, but length:

public class DigitsSum {
    public void printDigitsSum(int number){
    }
}

5. 9-s sum.

Write a program that will display the sum of the series [ 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 ... n]. Where n is a number passed as a method argument, n is the last number which consists of "9" n times:

public class NinesSum {
    public void calculateSum(int lengthOfLastNumber) {
    }
}

6. Fibonacci.

Write a program that will display the first n terms of Fibonacci series, each on new line:

public class FibonacciSeries {
    public void printFibonacci(int lastFibonacci) {
    }
}
